Welcome to my professional portfolio!  I am a **Mechanical Engineer** graduating from the University of Connecticut in **Spring 2026**. With a current GPA of **3.656**, I am enjoy design processes, aerodynamic problems, and doing hands-on projects.

## About Me:

I have gained hands-on experience through both **internships** and **school projects**. Over the summer of 2025, I had the opportunity to intern at the company **H&H**. Here, I was able to use skills learned throughout my education and model parts and designs in Autocad while also applying knowledge to compute calculations needed for other tasks. I was also a part of a project sponsored by the company **American Society of Naval Engineers** to construct an electric powered boat. My expertise includes:
